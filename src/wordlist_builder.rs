/**
 * Build the standard word-list for boxchar, which will be a list of words which are playable, along with
 * how frequent they are in english. The word-list will then be sorted by frequency, which will make it 
 * easier to display "good" solutions first.
 * 
 * We want to create the word list from two sources, which are both large text files.
 *    - the collins scrabble words, a newline-delimited text file, one word per line, e.g.
 *          AA
 *          AAH
 *          AAHED
 *          AAHING
 *          AAHS
 *    - a dump from google ngrams, a tab-separated newline-delimited text file, with integers representing 
 *      how frequent the word is. Larger is more frequent. The largest number here is ~ 2**36
 *          a       14219615690
 *          a!      196012
 *          a"      84
 *          a'      47713
 * 
 * We will iterate through both files simultaneously, outputing lines as appropriate, e.g. 
 *          aba 114620
 *          abac 5914
 *          abacas 423
 *          abaci 41132
 *          aback 1138210
 *
 * We expect the user to then sort the file appropriately with shell tools, e.g.
 *     $ cargo run wordlist-builder -- --frequencies data/google-ngrams-words-all.txt > /tmp/wordlist.txt 
 *     $ sort -k 2,2rn -k 1 /tmp/wordlist.txt > data/wordlist.txt
 *
